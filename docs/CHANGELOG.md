- Explanation when messages in a thread are hidden because the author is blocked by the author of the thread.

- Greek translation.
- Support for clicking magnet links.
- Auto-build with Travis CI (now supporting Snappy and Debian).
- Changelog.

### Changed
- Made legacy block handling easier to understand with new options on the profile page.
- Switched to a new module, ssb-suggest, to take care of @mention suggestions.
- Replaced "Search with Google" with "Search with DuckDuckGo" in the context menu.
- Started using an experimental branch of ssb-config that automatically configures multiple network interfaces so that they can be broadcast correctly by multiserver.
- Updated and deduplicated some npm dependencies.

### Removed
- Irrelevant prebuilds from build artifacts, which were bloating the size of releases.

### Fixed
- Problem where Patchwork would prompt user to add a name and description even when it wasn't their first time opening the application.
- Pagination bug that wasn't correctly showing messages on private, public, and profile feeds.
- EXIF stripping, which only works on JPG, TIF, and WAV files. Images that were converted from JPG/TIF/WAV may still have EXIF metadata embedded somewhere in the file, so it's important to know that Patchwork only rmeoves EXIF metadata from JPG/TIF/WAV.
